**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-01-02  

## Context
TechWayFit Blog Management System (BMS) exists as a mature, independent product.

## Decision

- Forge is the CMS-native blog module
- Optional integration via APIs/events
- No forced migration path

## Consequences
- No disruption to existing users
- Clear product boundaries
- Enables gradual adoption of ContentOS
