# ContentOS.Abstractions

This project contains **stable contracts**:
- Interfaces used by Core and Modules
- DTOs and events
- Capability descriptors and extension points

Rules:
- No dependency on Core/Api.
- Changes must be backward compatible.
- Breaking changes require ADR + version bump strategy.
